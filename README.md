# Quickstart Guide: Using Python Virtual Environments (venv) üêç

## Overview
A sample quickstart guide showing employees how to safely run Python scripts by using virtual environments (venv).  

## Audience  
Non-programmers and other personnel who are new to Python and/or seldomly use it for work projects.

## Why I wrote this: 
To practice writing step-by-step instructions for technical but mixed audiences. Many users struggle with Python environment setup (I know I did), so I created a clear, annotated guide with troubleshooting sections.

## What it demonstrates: 
- Breaking down complex workflows into concise, actionable steps.  
- Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility for non-experts.  
- Using annotated screenshots and glossaries to improve comprehension.
